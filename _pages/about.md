I am a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in deep learning and computer vision applications. I recently completed my MSc in Computing Science at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en), focusing on <em>Intelligent Systems & Visual Computing</em>. My thesis delved into contrastive self-supervised learning for predicting outcomes of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), leveraging solely their diagnostic imaging tests. This research was conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jiapan Guo](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.guo/) in collaboration with the [University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)](https://umcgresearch.org/).

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at Vodafone Greece, focusing on propensity machine learning models to optimize customer journey actions.


üí° <b>WHAT</b> ~ Emulate the innate learning processes and behaviors observed in humans and develop intelligent systems tailored for <br> human-centered applications.

üôèüèº <b>WHY </b> ~ Artificial intelligence serves as a nexus for diverse scientific disciplines, including programming, algorithms, mathematics, probabilities, statistics, and adaptable domain knowledge. Going beyond functionality, the amalgamation of these fields fosters the development of creative, dynamic, and integrated systems capable of understanding and modeling real-world scenarios from data. This prospect inspires me to contribute meaningfully and make a tangible impact in our society.
